Note the recording is stored in number 5 read in from researchdata_recordings folder


Analysis;

All data analysis is in analysis -> myanalysis folder. Copy over most recently generated .tsv files from 'p300' folder for analysis.

PSDaudio.py : Works out power spectral density and plots. Also prints SNR values.

weights.py : Plots weight distance

dnftraces.py: Plots traces obtained in the DNF UI

lmsplots.py: Plots preliminary experiment of LMS filter outputs

Note tsv.py program converts data files to .tsv files for data analysis (preliminary experiment outputs files as data, not .tsv).




Preliminary LMS: 

Run ./lmsdemo

Files are output to folder fir1-master -> demo
Note fir1-master contains original recording obtained in experiment (recording2bassn.wav & recording2voxs+n.wav)


Analysis;

lmsplots.py : Plots outputs from LMS filter (preliminary)

audioout.py : Converts .dat file to .wav
